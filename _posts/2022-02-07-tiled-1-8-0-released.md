Tiled 1.8 is here, bringing custom property types, configurable parallax
origin, repeatable image layers, many scripting and AutoMapping improvements
and a huge amount of fixes!

## Custom Property Types

Tiled has always had a pretty flexible custom property system, allowing you to
associate custom data with any of its data types. In this release, you can
define your own types for these properties. They come in two forms for now:
custom enums and custom classes.

### Custom Enums

Custom enums allow predefining a fixed set of valid values for a property. You
can choose whether their value is stored as string or number, and you can
choose whether to allow selecting a single value or multiple. When allowing
multiple values and storing the value as number, bitflags will be used.

Suppose for example, that the "enemies" in your game can be either Neutral,
Friendly or Aggressive. Now you can set up this enum in your project and you
no longer have to remember the numbers or type those values!

### Custom Classes

Custom classes allow predefining a set of properties, with custom default
values, which are always added as a unit. Maybe some of your objects have
physics enabled, and when they do, you want to see all the relevant
properties. Now you can!

As an added bonus, custom classes can use other custom classes as their
members, any change you make to your custom enums or classes is immediately
visible in the Properties view and changed properties are shown in bold and
easy to unset again.

## Parallax Origin and Image Layer Repeat

In Tiled 1.5, support was added for a parallax scrolling factor. In this
release, we added a [Parallax Origin][parallax-origin] property to each map,
which can be used to set the camera location at which the parallax offset is
0\. This can really help to match what you see in Tiled with what you see in
your game. Also the handling of the [parallax factor on group
layers][parallax-group-layer-fix] was fixed.

Somewhat related to parallax is the new support for repeating image layers.
They provide a convenient way of set up an infinite repeating background. Of
course, they're also perfect for adding entirely custom grids. Talking about
grids, the major grid can now be configured separately in the X and Y
directions.

## Scripting Extensions

Support for loading [JavaScript modules][scripting-modules] has been added
(recognized by their `.mjs` extension), which allows splitting up your
extension in multiple files without polluting the global scope.

There's a new [File interface][scripting-file], providing various file system
operations. It is now also possible to open a map or tileset created from a
script in Tiled without first saving it to a file, by assigning it to
[`tiled.activeAsset`][scripting-activeAsset]. The [`region`][scripting-region]
type got a lot more useful. 

These and many other small additions are included in the updated
[`tiled-api`][tiled-api] package, providing auto-completion and type checking
for Tiled extensions.

## AutoMapping Improvements

A number of quality-of-life improvements have been made to the [AutoMapping
system][automapping].

It is now possible to organize your rule maps using group layers, and using
group layers in your target maps also no longer breaks AutoMapping. The
`regions` layer can now be used alongside `region_input/output` layers for
defining shared regions. Layers in the rule map can be disabled by prefixing
their name with "//".

Finally, a rule map can now be referenced directly from a Tiled project or
used by [`TileMap.autoMap`][scripting-automap], without needing a `rules.txt`
file.

## Other Noteworthy Stuff

The multi-layer painting behavior was much improved, such that it now also
works when [multiple layers have the same
name](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled/issues/3094). In the common case
where you have the same number of layers selected as you are painting, it now
only uses the layer order and not their names to determine which layers to
modify. When it does need to use the names, it still also takes the order into
account and will not paint more than once to the same layer.

On the tool side, when placing a tile object it can now be flipped or rotated
[before placing it](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled/issues/3091). Also, the
object context menu is now available while using the object creation tools.
Finally, it is now much less likely to use the "Offset Layer" tool
accidentally, thanks to improved logic for automatic switching of tools.

The undo behavior was improved such that tile selection changes no longer mark
a file as modified. Also, subsequent edits to the same property no longer
create multiple undo commands. And in many cases, undo commands are now
automatically removed when they become "obsolete", for example when making a
layer visible and then invisible again.
