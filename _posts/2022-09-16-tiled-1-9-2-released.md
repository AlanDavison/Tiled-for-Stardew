This patch release addresses further issues in [Tiled 1.9][tiled-1.9], mostly
related to custom types. It also includes a number of small improvements.
Upgrading is highly recommended!

The [Defold export
plugins](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/export-defold/) (`defold`
and `defoldcollection`) now both support setting the tilesource using custom
properties and the `defold` plugin now also automatically assigns Z-values to
the exported layers. Just in time for the [#MadeWithDefold Jam
2022](https://itch.io/jam/madewithdefold-jam-2)!
