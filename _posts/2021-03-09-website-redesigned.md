The new Tiled website went live today, mentioning some of the features added
in past 8 years and highlighting a few awesome games made with Tiled!

Indeed, the [last update to the site's design][2013-website] was exactly 8
years ago. It was about time for a more modern look and to update the
presentation of Tiled's features, many of which did not exist when the
previous website was set up.

I've also added [a showcase][showcase] with some great games made with Tiled.
There are many out there (over 300 [games made with Tiled][made-with-tiled]
are listed just on itch.io) so it's a bit hard to choose which ones to show. I
tried to pick the most well-known ones. Let me know if your game should be
among them!

Finally the new site brings the latest news posts back to the top and also
adds a link to the recently registered [official Twitter handle][twitter]. If
you're [following me][twitter-bjorn] but are mostly interested in updates
about Tiled, be sure to give [@TiledApp][twitter] a follow!

Now let's hope the new website will last us for at least another 8 years! :-)
