This patch releases addresses a few serious issues in [Tiled 1.9][tiled-1.9],
including a crash when removing a custom property without having a project
loaded. Upgrading is highly recommended!

For Linux users, I'm sorry for breaking the "snap". Due to a lack of testing I
published a build that would not run at all. This release fixes that as well.

In general, I'm sorry for the wait on the patch release this time. Bad timing
to release a new major version just before leaving on holiday! I had intended
to finish 1.9 a little earlier, but next time I run out of time I should
probably delay the release.
